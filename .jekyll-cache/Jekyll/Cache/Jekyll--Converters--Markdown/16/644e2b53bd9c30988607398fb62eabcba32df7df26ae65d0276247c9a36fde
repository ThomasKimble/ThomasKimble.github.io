<h2 id="education">Education</h2>

<p>After graduating secondary school with a French Baccalauréat with a scientific orientation in 2015,
I obtained a Bachelor’s Degree in Microengineering in 2019, and am currently finishing my Master’s
degree in Robotics at <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/en/">EPFL</a> in Lausanne, Switzerland.</p>

<h2 id="hobbies">Hobbies</h2>

<p>I have always had a guitar around me and started playing at 7 years old. I have played in multiple bands,
and performed at festivals, in bars, outdoors, indoors… you name it! Curiosity lead me to also pick up
other instruments such as the drums and the piano over the years, allowing me to compose songs myself.</p>
