<p>After graduating secondary school with a French BaccalaurÃ©at with a scientific orientation in 2015,
I obtained a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Microengineering in 2019, and am currently finishing my Masterâ€™s
degree in Robotics at <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/en/">EPFL</a> in Lausanne, Switzerland.</p>

<h1 id="hobbies">Hobbies</h1>

<p>I have always had a guitar around me and started playing at 7 years old. I have played in multiple bands,
and performed at festivals, in bars, outdoors, indoorsâ€¦ you name it! Curiosity lead me to also pick up
other instruments such as the drums and the piano over the years, allowing me to compose songs myself.</p>
