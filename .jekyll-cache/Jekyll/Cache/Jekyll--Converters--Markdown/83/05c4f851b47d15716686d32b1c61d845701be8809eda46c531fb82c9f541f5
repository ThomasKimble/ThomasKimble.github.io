<h1 id="inspiration">Inspiration</h1>

<p>Having played the guitar from a young age, I have used many effect pedals. But it
was only recently that I discovered that the circuits inside were quite similar to
what I had been learning in my electronics and electrical engineering classes. I therefore decided to look into each of my pedals circuit design in more detail.</p>

<p>From this I decided to create a collection of my favourite effects and render them to
simulate a product line to potentially make and release one day.</p>

<h1 id="space-theme">Space Theme</h1>

<p>I needed to find a theme for the icons to put on each pedal. Along with Robotics, I
also have studied space technologies at EPFL for my Master’s degree. So I went with the
<strong>Space</strong> theme for my pedals.</p>

<p>Here is a list of the pedals I have currently designed circuits for:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Effect</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Big Dumb Booster</td>
      <td>Boost</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Chasma</td>
      <td>Chorus</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Comet</td>
      <td>Compression</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Drag</td>
      <td>Distortion</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Fuselage</td>
      <td>Fuzz</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Orbit</td>
      <td>Overdrive</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Tektite</td>
      <td>Tube Screamer</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Tidal Force</td>
      <td>Tremolo</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>I have plans for more, including different pedal shapes and sizes, some which can be
found in the 3D model viewer below.</p>

<h1 id="3d-models">3D Models</h1>

<p>I created casing for each pedal using <em>Catia V5</em>, my go to CAD software. I then uploaded the 3D models in <em>Blender</em> and created a studio like setting with different camera and lighting settings to render high quality images that showcase my designs. I used different textures to simulate painted and polished metal finishes and to created icons with <em>Adobe Illustrator</em> for each effect.</p>

<p>Some more fiddling in <em>Blender</em> allowed me to export the models in the <em>.glb</em> format which allowed me to showcase a more detailed view here on my website.</p>

<p>Feel free to have a play around with the models shown below!</p>

<h1 id="circuits">Circuits</h1>

<p>I have designed circuits for all of the pedals mentioned above and have tested a few of them
including the <strong>Fuselage</strong> fuzz circuit based off the <em>Electroharmonix Big Muff</em> Circuit. Here
is its schematic:</p>

<div class="web-image-full">
  <img src="../../images/project-images/pedals/Circuit.svg" />
</div>

<p>This circuit uses silicon transistors to create a fuzz effect. It consists of three stages:</p>
<ul>
  <li>An input booster controlled by the <em>Sustain</em> potentiometer</li>
  <li>Following is a clipping amplifier characterised by the clipping diodes <em>D1</em> to <em>D4</em> and a combination of high and low pass filters controlled with the <em>Tone</em> potentiometer</li>
  <li>We finish with an output booster circuit controlled by the <em>Volume</em> potentiometer</li>
</ul>
