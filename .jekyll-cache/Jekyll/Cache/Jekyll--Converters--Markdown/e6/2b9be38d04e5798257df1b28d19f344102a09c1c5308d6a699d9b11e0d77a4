<h1 id="personal-life">Personal life</h1>

<p>I was born in England and moved to Switzerland when I was 3 years old. I then moved to France at 5,
but continued my education in Switzerland.</p>

<p>Maths and Science have always intrigued me, so becoming an engineer was a natural decision as I have always
been fascinated as to how things work. I also have an eye for design and aesthetics, allowing me to show
a more creative side in contrast with my studies.</p>

<p>There has always a guitar around me and I started playing at 7 years old. I have played in multiple bands,
and performed at festivals, in bars, outdoors, indoors… you name it! Curiosity lead me to also pick up
other instruments such as the drums and the piano over the years, allowing me to compose songs myself.</p>

<h1 id="education">Education</h1>

<p>After graduating secondary school with a French Baccalauréat with a scientific orientation in 2015,
I obtained a Bachelor’s Degree in Microengineering in 2019, and am currently finishing my Master’s
degree in Robotics at <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/en/" target="_blank">EPFL</a> in Lausanne, Switzerland.</p>

<p>Microengineering at EPFL allowed me to develop skills in a lot of domains such as electrical engineering,
mechanical design, structural engineering, micro/nano-tech, software engineering and robotics. It was during my final
year that I developed a keen interest in robotics oriented software engineering, hence pursuing a Master’s degree in the domain.</p>
