<h1 id="personal-life">Personal life</h1>

<p>I was born in England and moved to Switzerland when I was 3 years old. I then moved to France at 5,
but continued my education in Switzerland.</p>

<p>Maths and Science have always intrigued me. Becoming an engineer was a natural decision as I have always
been fascinated as to how things work.</p>

<p>There has always a guitar around me and I started playing at 7 years old. I have played in multiple bands,
and performed at festivals, in bars, outdoors, indoorsâ€¦ you name it! Curiosity lead me to also pick up
other instruments such as the drums and the piano over the years, allowing me to compose songs myself.</p>

<h1 id="education">Education</h1>

<p>After graduating secondary school with a French BaccalaurÃ©at with a scientific orientation in 2015,
I obtained a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Microengineering in 2019, and am currently finishing my Masterâ€™s
degree in Robotics at <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/en/" target="_blank">EPFL</a> in Lausanne, Switzerland.</p>

<p>Microengineering at EPFL allowed me to develop skills in a lot of domains such as electrical engineering,
mechanical design, structural engineering, micro/nano-tech, software engineering and robotics. It was during my final
year that I developed a keen interest in robotics oriented software engineering, hence pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree in the domain.</p>
